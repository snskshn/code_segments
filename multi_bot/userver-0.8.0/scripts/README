These are some useful test scripts for running httperf - mainly 
for testing the userver.

See the source for details.

run           - do a specified number of requests (all for the same file)
run100K       - request a 100K byte file a specified number of times
run10K        - request a 100K byte file a specified number of times
run1K         - request a 100K byte file a specified number of times
runlog        - used to request files in a logfile 
                (see genfiles/genlog the runlog)
runlograte    - used to request files in a logfile at a specified rate
                (see genfiles/genlog the runlog)
runmix        - specify the
runmixrate
runpersist    - do a specified number of requests using only one connection
runrate       - specify a rate and the number of requests
runrate1K     - specify a rate and number of requests (requests larger file)
runsesslog    - specify a session log file to run (e.g., specweb99-like log)
                (see also genspec99sesslogs.c)
runuri        - request a specified file

There are some programs that are useful for generating test workloads.

Makefile

gen.h
genfiles.c
genlogs.c
  These files are used to generate and run some test 
  cases for testing the caching component of the server

genspec99sesslogs.c
  This program can be used to generate session log files that adhere
  to the distributions consistent with a specweb99 workload

permutesesslog 
  This program takes an httperf specific session log file
  and permutes it so that the same files are requested
  in a different order. This is useful so that you can
  have different clients requesting different sequences of files.

genspeclogs.c
  A precuror to genspec99sesslogs.c

kill-server
  Kill the server
Kill-server
  Kill -9 the server
