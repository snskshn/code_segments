The userver originally started out as separate implementations. 
Each implementation was in one file and each was about 1000 lines of code. 
Different files implemented event handling in a different manner.
It looks as if those implementations were created by
copying an existing implementation and then modifying the code to use
a different event handling mechanism. So there was significant amounts
of code that were common across the different files/implementations.

That code was written by:
  David Mosberger <david.mosberger@hp.com> and
  Abhishek Chandra <abhishek@cs.umass.edu>
and is Copyright (C) 2001 Hewlett-Packard Company

While on sabbatical at HP Labs I (Tim Brecht) created new versions
based on other event mechanisms we'd worked on at the
University of Waterloo.

Eventually, it became too difficult to ensure that when experiments
were run using the different programs/files that they were comparing
apples with apples because it was too easy for the different files to diverge
in places that didn't have solely to do with the event mechanisms.
So I create a unified version that used different event
mechanisms by choosing the event mechanism via command line arguments.

Much of the code related to using the Scalable Event Notification
and Delivery Mechanisms (SEND) were taken from bits of code
originally written by Michal Ostrowski as part of his M.Math thesis
at the University of Waterloo.

One of the hash functions (I've named do_hash_bob)
was taken from Bob Jenkin's Dr. Dobbs article from September, 1997.

(i.e., when sendfile is finished with them)
was contributed by Mark Groves.
