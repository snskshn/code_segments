This directory contains third-party and miscellaneous files related to
FastCGI.  The source code that implements FastCGI in userver is integrated
with the other source code in the src/ dir.

FCGI-0.67.tar.gz (CVS distribution only)
  FCGI.pm Perl library source.  Freely available from www.cpan.org.
  To build FCGI.pm with the patched version of fcgiapp.c:
    - extract the contents of FCGI-0.67.tar.gz
    - cd into the FCGI-0.67 directory
    - apply the patch:
        patch -p2 < ../fcgi-2.4.0.patch
      (adjust the path to fcgi-2.4.0.patch as necessary)
    - build and optionally install FCGI.pm as instructed in the README:
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install

Makefile (CVS distribution only)
  Used to build/install FastCGI applications found in this directory.

NOTES
  Design and implementation notes.

fcgi-2.4.0.patch
  This patch modifies the standard FastCGI library source in several ways:
    - fixes a bug which may cause ReadParams() to block forever, e.g. on
      reception of an FCGI_GET_VALUES message
    - adds support for three environment variables -- FCGI_STDIN_BUFSIZE,
      FCGI_STDOUT_BUFSIZE, FCGI_STDERR_BUFSIZE -- which allow runtime tuning
      of the stdin, stdout, and stderr buffer sizes, respectively
    - adds support for an experimental way of transferring STDOUT/STDERR
      data to the webserver using shared memory
    - adds support for the new FCGI_SET_VALUES management record, which is
      used in the shared memory support
  This patch can be applied to the files found inside fcgi-2.4.0.tar.gz as
  well as those found inside FCGI-0.67.tar.gz (which are in fact just taken
  from fcgi-2.4.0.tar.gz).  See the descriptions for those files for
  instructions on applying the patch.

fcgi-2.4.0.tar.gz (CVS distribution only)
  FastCGI development kit from Open Market.  Freely available from
  www.fastcgi.com.
  To build the FastCGI library with the patched version of fcgiapp.c:
    - extract the contents of fcgi-2.4.0.tar.gz
    - cd into the fcgi-2.4.0/libfcgi directory
    - apply the patch:
        patch -p1 < ../fcgi-2.4.0.patch
      (adjust the path to fcgi-2.4.0.patch as necessary)
    - cd up one level into the fcgi-2.4.0 directory
    - build and optionally install the library as instructed in the README:
        ./configure
        make
        make install

fcgiclient.c
  A simple FastCGI test client that sends a dummy request to a FastCGI
  application.  Use with test-fcgi.pl.

fcgiserv (CVS distribution only)
  Shell script to start/stop SPECweb99 and test FastCGI processes.

specweb99-fcgi.c (CVS distribution only)
  FastCGI application which handles SPECweb99 requests.  Listens on port
  9000 by default and handles requests until killed.
  Created by porting specweb99-zisapi.c in the SPECweb99 distribution
  from ISAPI to FastCGI.

specweb99-fcgi.pl (CVS distribution only)
  Perl equivalent of specweb99-fcgi.c.
  Created by applying specweb99-fcgi.pl.patch (see below) to the original
  specweb99-fcgi.pl in the SPECweb99 distribution.

specweb99-fcgi.pl.patch
  Patch to get specweb99-fcgi.pl from the SPECweb99 distribution (under
  server-docs/) working.  To apply the patch, issue this command with
  specweb99-fcgi.pl in the current directory:
    patch < specweb99-fcgi.pl.patch
  (adjust the path to specweb99-fcgi.pl.patch as necessary)

test-fcgi.c
  A simple FastCGI test application which prints out the contents of its
  environment and a list of CGI parameters it received.  Listens on port
  8000 by default and handles requests until killed.

test-fcgi.pl
  Perl equivalent of test-fcgi.c.  Requires FCGI.pm to be properly installed
  (see notes on fcgiapp.c.patch).
