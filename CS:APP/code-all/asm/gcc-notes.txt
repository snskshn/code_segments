Notes on GCC

Compare:

GCC running on Cobia.  Even with -m32, knows that is x86_64 machine
GCC running on Intel machine.  Generic x86

Architecture flags tested (-march=XXX)

i386
	     Generic x86.
	     Cannot force to use SSE

i686
	     Uses cond. move  (Even works on old versions of GCC)
	     Cannot force to use SSE


pentium4
prescott
opteron
core2

	    All similar.  Use cond. move.
	    if also say -mfpmath=sse, then uses SSE.
	    Bass: Only pentium4
	    Cobia: Not core2

Variations seen:

compiler-eg.c:
	Comp&incr trick for abs val
	Use cmov
	Use cltd to create mask (opteron)

loop.c:
	Use jump to middle for fact_while
	Use 3 instruction loop for fact_while
