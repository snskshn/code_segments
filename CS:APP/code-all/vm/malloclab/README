This directory contains solutions for the malloc lab that are 
both 32-bit and 64-bit clean.


***********
Main Files:
***********

mm.c
	Symbolic link to the current version of malloc, one of
	mm-implicit.c, mm-explicit.c, or mm-seglist.c. Type "make
	implicit", "make explicit" or "make seglist" to install one of these
	solutions.

mm-implicit.c
        The implicit list allocator described in CS:APP2e.
mm-explicit.c
        An explicit list allocator.
mm-seglist.c
        A segmented list allocator.

mdriver.c	
	The malloc driver that tests the mm.c file for correctness,
	space efficiency, and performance.

mdriver
        Once you've run make, run ./mdriver to test your solution.

traces/
	Directory that contains the trace files that the driver uses
	to test your solution. Files orners.rep, short2.rep, and malloc.rep
	are tiny trace files that you can use for debugging correctness.

**********************************
Other support files for the driver
**********************************

config.h	Configures the malloc lab driver
fsecs.{c,h}	Wrapper function for the different timer packages
clock.{c,h}	Routines for accessing the Pentium and Alpha cycle counters
fcyc.{c,h}	Timer functions based on cycle counters
ftimer.{c,h}	Timer functions based on interval timers and gettimeofday()
memlib.{c,h}	Models the heap and sbrk function

*******************************
Building and running the driver
*******************************
To build the driver, type "make" to the shell.

To run the driver on a tiny test trace:

	unix> ./mdriver -V -f traces/malloc.rep

To get a list of the driver flags:

	unix> ./mdriver -h

The -V option prints out helpful tracing information
