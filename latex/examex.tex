{\large\bf Answer Three Questions}
\end{center}

\newpage
{\large\bf 1.}\\
{\large\bf (i)} Given that the set of all $3\times 3$ orthogonal
real matrices with determinant $+1$
forms a group $SO(3)$ under matrix multiplication, prove that $SO(3)$ has a
subgroup $R_Z$ consisting of rotations about the $z$-axis. Write down without proof
the definitions of two other subgroups, $R_X, \, R_Y,$ of $SO(3),$ corresponding
to rotations about the $x$-axis and $y$-axis respectively.

{\large\bf (ii)} Prove that the map
$$g:[0,2\pi]\times [-\pi/2,\pi/2]\rightarrow \E^3 :
(u,v) \mapsto (\cos v \cos u, \cos v\sin u, \sin v)$$ provides a parametrization
of the standard unit sphere $\bS^2.$

{\large\bf (iii)} Prove that $R_Z$ defines an action on the
standard unit sphere $\bS^2$ by the map $$\rho:R_Z\times \bS^2
\rightarrow \bS^2 : ([A_{ij}],[p_j]) \mapsto
[\sum_{k=1}^{k=3}A_{ik}p_k]$$ and find its orbits. Prove also that
this action is effective but neither free nor transitive.

{\large\bf (iv)} Find a parametric equation for the equator curve on $\bS^2$ in the form
$$e:[0,2\pi]\rightarrow \bS^2$$
and find the parameter value $t_0\in [0,2\pi]$ such that
$$e(t_0)=(\frac{1}{\sqrt 2},\frac{1}{\sqrt 2},0) = p, \  {\rm say}.$$
Find a parametric equation for the great circle $\gamma$ through $p$ and inclined at
angle $\pi/6$ to the equator, so that $\gamma(t_1)=p$ for some $t_1$ in the domain
of $\gamma$ and $\gamma'(t_1)$ makes an angle $\pi/6$ with $e'(t_0)$ at $p.$
What is the torsion of $\gamma?$

\newpage
{\large\bf 2.}\\
Let $\alpha :(a,b)\rightarrow \E^3$ be a regular curve with positive curvature $\kappa,$
torsion $\tau$ and a Frenet-Serret frame field $(T,N,B).$

Denote by $s:(a,b)\rightarrow \R$ the arc length function and suppose that
$\hat{\alpha} :(c,d)\rightarrow \E^3$ is a unit speed reparametrization of $\alpha.$

Denote by $\hat{\kappa}$ and
$\hat{\tau}$ the curvature and torsion respectively of $\hat{\alpha},$ and
by $(\hat{T},\hat{N},\hat{B})$ the Frenet-Serret frame field of $\hat{\alpha}.$

{\large\bf (i)} Write down without proof
the Frenet-Serret equations for $\hat{\alpha}$ and use the definitions
\begin{eqnarray*}
\kappa(t) &=& \hat{\kappa}(s(t)) \\
\tau(t) &=& \hat{\tau}(s(t)) \\
T(t) &=& \hat{T}(s(t)) \\
N(t) &=& \hat{N}(s(t)) \\
B(t) &=& \hat{B}(s(t))
\end{eqnarray*}
to obtain the Frenet-Serret equations for $\alpha.$

{\large\bf (ii)} Prove that $\alpha$ has acceleration
$$\alpha'' = s''T+(s')^2\kappa N$$
with curvature
$$\kappa = \frac{||\alpha' \times\alpha''||}{||\alpha'||^3}$$
and torsion
$$\tau = \frac{\alpha' \times\alpha''\cdot \alpha'''}{||\alpha'\times \alpha''||^2}.$$




{\large\bf (iii)} Find the curvature and torsion of the twisted cubic curve
$$\alpha: (0,1) \rightarrow \E^3 : t \mapsto (t,t^2,t^3).$$

\newpage
{\large\bf 3.} \\
Let $\Phi:M_1\rightarrow M_2$ be a local isometry between two
regular surfaces $M_1$ and $M_2$ in $\E^3$ with Gaussian curvatures
$K_1,K_2,$ respectively. A famous theorem of Gauss states
that then
$$K_1=K_2\circ\Phi.$$

Prove by counterexample that the converse is false by considering the funnel
surface $M_1$ with patch map
$$(u,v)\mapsto (v\cos u,v\sin u, \log v)$$
the helicoid $M_2$ with patch map
$$(u,v)\mapsto (v\cos u,v\sin u, u)$$
and the diffeomorphism
$$\Phi:M_1\rightarrow M_2:(v\cos u,v\sin u, \log v)\mapsto (v\cos u,v\sin u, u).$$

Do this by showing that this $M_1$ and $M_2$ have the same curvature at corresponding
points under $\Phi,$ but $\Phi$ is not an isometry.
You may use without proof the Weingarten result that the determinant of the shape
operator $S$ is given by
$$\det S = \frac{eg-f^2}{EG-F^2}$$
when the arc length formula is
$$ds^2=Edu^2+2Fdudv+Gdv^2$$
and, for a unit normal field $\hat{n}$ and a patch map $x,$ the second fundamental form
has components given by
$$e=\hat{n}\cdot x_{uu}, \ \ f=\hat{n}\cdot x_{uv}, \ \ g=\hat{n} \cdot x_{vv}.$$

{\large\bf 4.}\\
{\large\bf (i)}
Draw a projection of an oriented trefoil knot $T,$ and number the overcrossings. From
your drawing, write down without proof
a matrix from which the Alexander polynomial ${\cal A}(T)$
may be found as the monic factor of a determinant. Find ${\cal A}(T).$

{\large\bf (ii)}
Take an identical pair of oriented trefoil knots and by joining them together
form an oriented sum knot, $R;$
take two more oriented trefoil knots, one the mirror image of
the other, and join them to form a different
summand oriented knot, $G;$ do this in such a way that $R$ and $G$ each have
a projection with six overcrossings. [In fact, one of your summands should be
the square knot and the other should be the granny knot.]
Find suitable
such projections, number the overcrossings and then compute for $R,G$ without proof
the Alexander polynomials ${\cal A}(R)$ and ${\cal A}(G).$

{\large\bf (iii)}
Write down an equation relating the three polynomials,
${\cal A}(T),$ ${\cal A}(R)$ and ${\cal A}(G).$
