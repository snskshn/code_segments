The book `C Interfaces and Implementations' by David Hanson describes
more than 20 general-purpose interfaces and their implementations. The
source code for everything in this book is available for anonymous ftp
as described below.

The distribution directory contains the following files and
directories. MD5 fingerprints for the files in this directory are
listed below.

README	this file.

ciiXY.tar.{Z,gz}
	compressed tar files for the distribution of version X.Y, e.g.,
	cii10.tar.Z. The tar file is compressed with compress. A .gz
	file is the tar file compressed with gzip instead of compress.

ciiXY.zip
	compressed archive of the distribution of version X.Y in PKZIP
	2.04g format. ASCII files in this archive are in MS-DOS format;
	that is, their lines are terminated with CRLF.

contrib/
	holds distribution files for user-contributed software;
	contrib/README gives details.

old/	holds previous distributions.

The distribution is available via `anonymous' ftp from
ftp.cs.princeton.edu (128.112.136.12) in the directory
pub/packages/cii. Obtaining and extracting the distribution into its
own directory is accomplished by the following commands. Replace `10'
with the latest version; versions like `11b2' identify beta releases
(which might be incomplete). As suggested, use your email address as
the password, and use ftp's binary transfer mode.

mkdir cii
cd cii
ftp ftp.cs.princeton.edu
anonymous
your email address
cd pub/packages/cii
binary
get cii10.tar.Z
quit
zcat cii10.tar | tar xpof -
rm cii10.tar.Z
